------

Having discussed various elements in Descartes's metaphysics and epistemology
we turn, over the next weeks, to various ways in which these views are
elaborated, explained, or critiqued. We look this week at criticism and
defense of Descartes's notion of an 'innate idea' in the work of Locke and Leibniz.
