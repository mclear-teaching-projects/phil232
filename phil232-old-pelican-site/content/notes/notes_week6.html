<h2 id="quiz">Quiz</h2>
<ol>
<li>In Med 3 Descartes articulates 2 proofs of the existence of God. Name one.
<ul>
<li>casual argument from idea of God</li>
<li>preservation/creation of finite beings</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In his first proof of God’s existence D uses a metaphysical principle. Name the principle &amp; briefly describe its content
<ul>
<li>Causal principle</li>
</ul></li>
<li>T/F: Descartes explains the existence of error as arising because of the relation between the imagination and the understanding
<ul>
<li>F</li>
</ul></li>
<li>T/F: Descartes thinks that finite substances lack the power to persist through time on their own
<ul>
<li>T</li>
</ul></li>
<li>T/F: Descartes thinks that the power to preserve is the same the as the power to create
<ul>
<li>T</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-cartesian-circle">The &quot;Cartesian Circle&quot;</h2>
<ol>
<li>I can be certain of P only if I am certain that Q</li>
<li>I can be certain of Q only if I am certain that P</li>
</ol>
<p>P: whatever I perceive clearly and distinctly is true Q: God exists and is not a deceiver</p>
<p>How does Descartes avoid the circular reasoning? Can he deny either or both of (1) or (2)?</p>
<h2 id="descartess-memory-response">Descartes's Memory Response</h2>
<ul>
<li>We don't need proof of God's existence and non-deceitful nature to certify C&amp;D perception, rather only need proof of God to show that we can rely on memory of C&amp;D perception</li>
<li>Worry: doesn't really answer the fundamental objection that we need some certification for C&amp;D perception <em>itself</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="alternative-strategies-for-resolving-the-circle">Alternative Strategies for resolving the Circle</h2>
<h3 id="mere-psychological-certainty-not-truth">1. Mere psychological certainty not truth</h3>
<ul>
<li>Maybe Descartes is just after unshakable psychological certainty or conviction rather than truth</li>
<li>Unsatisfying as a general explanation of what Descartes is doing in the Meditations (e.g. unsatisfying as explanation of Med 5 argument concerning our intellectual grasp of essences)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="remove-the-doubt">2. Remove the doubt</h3>
<p>Descartes isn't trying to prove that C&amp;D perception is <em>true</em>, only that we have no defensible grounds for doubting C&amp;D perception</p>
<ul>
<li>Maybe not going to work since even just removing doubt about decietful god via appeal to our idea of God will rely on C&amp;D perception of the content of our idea of God</li>
<li>Doesn't seem to remove grounds for doubting a &quot;defective origins&quot; style objection as from Med 1 (7:21)</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><p>Two Validation Projects</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Strong Validation of the Intellect</p>
<p>The intellect is capable of discovering and knowing/justifying metaphysical principles concerning reality</p></li>
<li><p>Weak Validation of the Intellect</p>
<p>There are no good grounds for doubting the deliverances of the intellect – it is a (generally) reliable faculty for knowledge</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="presumption-in-favor-of-the-intellect">3. Presumption in favor of the intellect</h3>
<p>Why couldn't the Meditator reasonably begin with the presumption of the reliability of the human intellect?</p>
<ul>
<li>Worry: begs the question against those who doubt the power/reliability of intellect</li>
<li>Worry: doesn't account for how we can have knowledge of essences of real objects (e.g. knowledge of essence of matter or God)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="is-the-circle-inescapable">Is the Circle Inescapable?</h2>
<ul>
<li>If D is after a &quot;strong validation&quot; of the intellect then he may be unable to escape the circle since he would need positive proof that the method of C&amp;D perception is reliable but his only such positive proofs (e.g. God's existence) rely on that very method</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="is-descartess-problem-our-problem">Is Descartes's Problem our Problem?</h2>
<dl>
<dt>&quot;Problem of the criterion&quot;</dt>
<dd>whether or not we need to know the epistemic principles which justify our claims to knowledge prior to (and perhaps independently of) any knowledge that we have, including knowledge that might be necessary for formulating the principles.
</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="meditation-6">Meditation 6</h2>
<h3 id="three-kinds-of-distinctness">Three kinds of distinctness</h3>
<ol>
<li>conceptual</li>
<li>distinction necessary for the intelligibility of something</li>
<li>modal</li>
<li>distinction between properties or modes, but not between things</li>
<li>real</li>
<li>distinction between existing things (applies only to substance) – specifically that they <em>could</em> exist independent of one another (whether they actually do or not).</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="the-real-distinction-argument">The real distinction argument</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>Three claims</p>
<dl>
<dt>Complete Being<sub>T</sub></dt>
<dd>a thinking thing can exist as a substance whose sole essence is thought.
</dd>
<dt>Complete Being<sub>B</sub></dt>
<dd>body can exist as a substance whose sole essence is extension.
</dd>
<dt>Mutual Exclusion</dt>
<dd>mental substance has no bodily modes, and bodily substance has no mental modes.
</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li><p>God's power</p>
<p>Part [A] says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[A] I know that everything which I clearly and distinctly understand is capable of being created by God so as to correspond exactly with my understanding of it. Hence the fact that I can clearly and distinctly understand one thing apart from another is enough to make me certain that the two things are distinct, since they are capable of being separated, at least by God. The question of what kind of power is required to bring about such a separation does not affect the judgement that the two things are distinct.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is what part A <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-modal/#ReaDis">seems to be arguing</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>I clearly and distinctly understand mind apart from body and body apart from mind.</li>
<li>God can bring about whatever I clearly and distinctly perceive.</li>
<li>God can bring about that mind is apart from body and body is apart from mind.</li>
<li>If God can bring about that mind is apart from body and body is apart from mind, then mind and body can exist apart.</li>
<li><p>∴ Mind and body can exist apart.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How do we know that we are C&amp;D perceiving mind apart from body, etc.?</p></li>
<li><p>What we would want is a <strong>natural</strong> distinction between mind &amp; body, not a <strong>supernatural</strong> or <strong>miraculous</strong> distinction</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Knowing one's essence</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[B] Thus, simply by knowing that I exist and seeing at the same time that absolutely nothing else belongs to my nature or essence except that I am a thinking thing, I can infer correctly that my essence consists solely in the fact that I am a thinking thing.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>One's self exists</li>
<li>Nothing belongs to one’s essence or nature other than thinking</li>
<li>∴ All properties of oneself have to be conceived via this essence – thought</li>
</ol>
<p>Is this argument enough to yield the Real Distinction? Presumably not – it just tells us that our essence is that of a thinking being, it doesn’t tell us that all thinking beings are independent of any body. It doesn’t give us Mutual Exclusion. But it does give us Complete Being-T.</p></li>
<li><p>Real distinctness</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[C] It is true that I may have (or, to anticipate, that I certainly have) a body that is very closely joined to me. But nevertheless, on the one hand I have a clear and distinct idea of myself, in so far as I am simply a thinking, non-extended thing; and on the other hand I have a distinct idea of body, in so far as this is simply an extended, non-thinking thing. And accordingly, it is certain that I am really distinct from my body, and can exist without it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to the Meditator's distinct and clear ideas:</p>
<ol>
<li>The self is a thinking and non-extended thing</li>
<li>Corporeal substance is extended and non-thinking</li>
</ol>
<p>This gives us <em>Mutual Exclusion</em>. If we assume Complete Being<sub>B</sub> then it seems D gives us what we need to conclude that mind and body are Really Distinct</p>
<ul>
<li>Is it clear that if a thing can exist that has no bodily properties then that thing can exist apart from bodies?
<ul>
<li>could there be some other kind of dependence relation between minds and bodies apart from modal/property dependence?
<ul>
<li>not, presumably, if we are talking about substances, since substances are independent beings</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Objections</p>
<ul>
<li>How do we know that the apparent distinctness of mind and body is not due to our ignorance of their real identity?</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Suppose someone knows for certain that the angle in a semi-circle is a right angle, and hence that the triangle formed by this angle and the diameter of the circle is right-angled. In spite of this, he may doubt, or not yet have grasped for certain, that the square on the hypotenuse is equal to the squares on the other two sides; indeed he may even deny this if he is misled by some fallacy. But now, if he uses the same argument as that proposed by our illustrious author, he may appear to have confirmation of his false belief, as follows: 'I clearly and distinctly perceive', he may say, 'that the triangle is right-angled; but I doubt that the square on the hypotenuse is equal to the squares on the other two sides; therefore it does not belong to the essence of the triangle that the square on its hypotenuse is equal to the squares on the other sides.' (7:201-2)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Descartes’s answer, perhaps unsurprisingly, refers to what the Meditator has learned so far</p>
<ul>
<li>(i) the fact that the Meditator has clear and distinct ideas of mind and body, where each excludes the features of other</li>
<li>(ii) the nature of clear and distinct ideas is such that they adequately represent how reality is (or what is really possible).</li>
</ul>
<p>So Descartes simply denies Arnauld’s premise, that the subject has a clear and distinct idea of a right triangle. If they really did have such an idea, Descartes argues, they would know that the Pythagorean theorem is true of such triangles.</p>
<p>To reject Descartes’s argument we must reject either</p>
<ul>
<li>(i) the claim that we (or the Meditator) have clear and distinct ideas of the mind as distinct from the body, or</li>
<li>(ii) that clear and distinct perception is a reliable guide to real possibility/actuality.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Causation:</p>
<p>The dualist position articulated here raises problems for D - how do minds and bodies interact, if at all?</p>
<ul>
<li>Interactionism</li>
<li>Occasionalism</li>
<li>Parallelism</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
