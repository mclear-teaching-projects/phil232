#+TITLE: Week 13 - Spinoza's Monism & Hume's Mind
#+DATE: April 9, 2018
#+SLUG: week13-spinoza
#+TAGS: essence, grounding, monism, substance, Spinoza

------

This week we look at Spinoza's infamous monism as an approach to resolving
ambiguities and issues in Descartes's conception of substance. We'll discuss
Spinoza's argument that there can be only one substance, which he identifies
as God or Nature. And we'll look at some criticism of that argument. We'll
also start our discussion of Hume's conception of the mind.
