<blockquote>
<p>
I have also used the comparison with a block of veined marble, rather than a
completely uniform block of marble, or an empty tablet, that is, what the
philosophers call a tabula rasa. For if the soul were like these empty
tablets, truths would be in us as the shape of Hercules is in a block of
marble, when the marble is completely indifferent to receiving this shape or
another. But if the stone had veins which marked out the shape of Hercules
rather than other shapes, then that block would be more determined with
respect to that shape and Hercules would be as though innate in it in some
sense, even though some labor would be required for these veins to be exposed
and polished into clarity by the removal of everything that prevents them from
appearing. This is how ideas and truths are innate in us, as natural
inclinations, dispositions, habits, or potentialities [virtualites] are, and
not as actions are, although these potentialities are always accompanied by
some corresponding, though often insensible, actions. (<i>NE Preface</i>, Garber p. 294)

<blockquote>
<p>
Now I say that whenever I conceive any material or corporeal substance, I
immediately feel the need to think of it as bounded, and as having this or
that shape…[etc.]…From these conditions I cannot separate such a substance
by any stretch of my imagination. But that it must be white or red, bitter
or sweet, noisy or silent, and of sweet or foul odor, my mind does not feel
compelled to bring in as necessary accompaniments. Without the senses as
our guides, reason or imagination unaided would probably never arrive at
qualities like these. Hence I think that tastes, odors, colors, and so on
are no more than mere names so far as the object in which we place them is
concerned, and that they reside only in the consciousness (Galileo, p.
274).

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Thinking of a material object requires thinking of it as having a particular
set of qualities (i.e. size, shape, location, motion, etc.)</li>
<li>Thinking of a material object does not require thinking of it as having
specific sensory qualities (e.g. color, taste, smell, sound)</li>
<li>The only qualities possessed by a material object are those which we must
attribute to it in thought</li>
<li>∴ Sensory qualities are not qualities of material objects, but rather
features of our consciousness of those objects — i.e. “sensations” [from 2, 3]</li>
<li>∴ If there were no conscious beings there would be no sensory qualities (e.g.
colors, tastes, smells, etc.). [from 4]</li>

<li>Why should we accept (3)?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Descartes gives us one argument for accepting (3) but Galileo provides no
such epistemological foundation, though he certainly could make use of D's
system as the backdrop for such an argument</li>

matter which has bulk enough to be perceived; and the mind finds inseparable
from every particle of matter, though less than to make itself singly be
perceived by our senses: v.g. Take a grain of wheat, divide it into two
parts; each part has still solidity, extension, figure, and mobility: divide
it again, and it retains still the same qualities; and so divide it on, till
the parts become insensible; they must retain still each of them all those

<div id="outline-container-orgd87a333" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgd87a333">Locke on Kinds</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgd87a333">
<p>
Locke's view concerning general kinds (e.g. cat, dog, gold) is that there are
no such things that really exist. All there are are particular beings with
some degree or other of resemblance. 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
it is plain, by what has been said, that general and universal belong not to
the real existence of things; but are the inventions and creatures of the
understanding, made by it for its own use, and concern only signs, whether
words or ideas. (III.iii.11)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Locke expands on this position slightly. 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
I would not here be thought to forget, much less to deny, that Nature, in the
production of things, makes several of them alike: there is nothing more
obvious, especially in the race of animals, and all things propagated by seed.
But yet I think we may say, the sorting of them under names is the workmanship
of the understanding, taking occasion, from the similitude it observes amongst
them, to make abstract general ideas, and set them up in the mind, with names
annexed to them, as patterns or forms, (for, in that sense, the word form has
a very proper signification,) to which as particular things existing are found
to agree, so they come to be of that species, have that denomination, or are
put into that <i>classis</i>. (III.iii.13)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
There is a bit of a tension here between saying that some things are more
alike than other, but that things do not fall naturally into classes, instead
classes are the "workmanship of the understanding".

<h4 id="org1c75ace">Role of Essences in Proper Scientific Knowledge</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org1c75ace">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Scientific knowledge consists in saying why things are the way that
there are for the members of the given domain.</li>
<li>Knowledge depends on articulation of real definitions of the subject
matter of the science, which articulate the essences, or fundamental
explanatory features, of the relevant individuals studied.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>/Essences/: individuate kinds, and explain why members of the kind
have the features that they do.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>propria/: necessary but not explanatorily fundamental features
of a thing&#x2014;propria may be /inferred</i> from the essence
(risibility in humans).</li>
<li><i>accidents/: non-necessary and idiosyncratic features of a
thing&#x2014;accidents are /not</i> inferrable from the essence
(e.g. the blackness of crows), though they may nevertheless
<i>depend</i> on the essence.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Scientific knowledge depends on articulation of the essences of
the relevant members in order to provide simple real definitions.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Scientific definition proceeds by specifying:

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the kind to which its members belong (<i>genus</i>)</li>
<li>the name of the thing (<i>species</i>) defined by its principle feature
(<i>difference</i>)</li>
<li>the characteristics (<i>properties</i>) which ‘flow from' that
principle feature</li>
<li>the remaining characteristics which are typical of the thing
though not inferable from its principle feature (<i>accidents</i>)</li>
</ul></li>

<li>A fully articulated proper science would be one which provides a set
of real definitions of its members from which all the properties have
been inferred or derived.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Euclidean geometry is often taken as an
exemplar
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Definition of a circle gives us the essence of the circle from
which its other properties may be derived/deduced.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>
The conception or definition of the thing must be such that all the
properties of the thing, when regarded by itself and not in conjunction
with other things, can be deduced from it, as can be seen in the case of
this definition of a circle. For from it we clearly deduce that all the
lines drawn from the centre to the circumference are equal. (Spinoza,
<i>Treatise on the Emendation of the Intellect</i>, 96)

<h4 id="orgd2d3832">Real vs. Nominal Essence</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgd2d3832">
<p>
Locke distinguishes between two kinds of essence.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
First, essence may be taken for the very being of any thing, whereby it is
what it is. And thus the real internal, but generally in Substances, unknown
constitution of things, whereon their discoverable qualities depend, may be
called their essence. This is the proper original signiﬁcation of the word. .
. . (Essay III.iii.15) 
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The distinction originally comes from Aristotle, but there concerns
<i>definitions</i>. Locke goes on to distinguish the nominal notion of essence in
terms of his conception of nominal kinds. 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
‘Tis true, there is ordinarily supposed a real constitution of the sorts of
Things; and ‘tis past doubt, there must be some real constitution, on which
any collection of simple Ideas co-existing, must depend. But it being evident,
that Things are ranked under names into sorts or Species, only as they agree
to certain abstract Ideas, to which we have annexed those names, the Essence
of each Genus, or Sort, comes to be nothing but that abstract Idea, which the
general, or Sortal (if I may have leave so to call it from Sort, as I do
General from Genus,) name stands for. and this we shall find to be that which
the word Essence imports, in its most familiar use. These two sorts of
Essences, I suppose, may not unfitly be termed, the one the Real, the other
Nominal Essence. (III.iii.15)
</p>
</blockquote>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Real Essence:</dt><dd>The property or properties necessary for (i) objectively
determining the particular's resemblance relations to other
particulars; (ii) upon which many or all of its other
monadic properties depend.</dd>
<dt>Nominal Essence:</dt><dd>The property or properties specified by some kind term,
by which we sort an individual into a particular kind.

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>We sort things in terms of their nominal, rather than real,
essences.</li>
<li>We cannot sort things in terms of their real essences.</li>
</ol></dd>
</dl>

<p>
Locke expands on this position. 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
concerning the real Essences of corporeal Substances, (to mention these only,)
there are, if I mistake not, two Opinions. The one is of those, who using the
word Essence, for they know not what, suppose a certain number of those
Essences, according to which, all natural things are made, and wherein they do
exactly every one of them partake, and so become of this or that Species. The
other, and more rational Opinion, is of those, who look on all natural Things
to have a real, but unknown constitution of their insensible Parts, from which
flow those sensible Qualities, which serve us to distinguish them one from
another, according as we have Occasion to rank them into sorts, under common
denominations. (III.iii.17)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This might suggest that two particulars might have the same real essence,
which explains why the particulars resemble one another in various ways (as,
e.g., two dogs might resemble one another). But Locke seems to think that no
two real essences are alike. 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The frequent Productions of Monsters, in all the Species of animals, and of
changelings, and other strange issues of humane Birth, carry with them
difficulties, not possible to consist with this Hypothesis: Since it is as
impossible, that two Things, partaking exactly of the same real Essence,
should have different Properties, as that two figures partaking of the same
real Essence of a circle, should have different Properties. But were there no
other reason against it, yet the supposition of Essences, that cannot be
known; and the making of them nevertheless to be that, which distinguishes the
Species of Things, is so wholly useless, and unserviceable to any part of our
Knowledge, that that alone were sufficient to make us lay it by; and content
ourselves with such Essences of the Sorts or Species of Things, as come within
the reach of our Knowledge: which, when seriously considered, will be found,
as I have said, to be nothing else, but those abstract complex Ideas, to which
we have annexed distinct general Names. (III.iii.17)
</p>
</blockquote>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>if the real essence of an individual determined its sensible properties, then two individuals with the same real essence should not differ (so much) in their sensible properties</li>
<li>“monsters” (offspring that are thought to be of the same real essence as their parents) are occasionally produced in nature</li>
<li>∴ the real essence does not determine sensible properties OR there
are only particular real essences (i.e. no particulars "share" the
same real essence)</li>

Locke gives what sounds like a more epistemic rather than metaphysical
argument concerning the problems with knowing about real essences of things in
III.vi.19
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The only imaginable help in this case would be, that, having framed perfect
complex ideas of the properties of things flowing from their different real
essences, we should thereby distinguish them into species. But neither can
this be done. For, being ignorant of the real essence itself, it is impossible
to know all those properties that flow from it, and are so annexed to it, that
any one of them being away, we may certainly conclude that that essence is not
there, and so the thing is not of that species. We can never know what is the
precise number of properties depending on the real essence of gold, any one of
which failing, the real essence of gold, and consequently gold, would not be
there, unless we knew the real essence of gold itself, and by that determined
that species. (III.vi.19)
