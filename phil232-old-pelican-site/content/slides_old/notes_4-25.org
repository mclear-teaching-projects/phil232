* Personal Identity
- Where does the idea of a persisting self/subject come from?
  - Not from experience?
    - The idea of a self must be in some sense fictitious 
      
** The bundle theory
- The subject is just a collection of impressions and ideas
  1. What holds together the various elements of the bundle?
  2. What explains our sense of ourselves as subjects? And why we would
     mistakenly think that we are substantial beings?
     
*** Explanation of (2)
- Distinguish between:
  - Strict identity :: persistence without alteration
  - Similarity :: resemblance in some respect
 
                  
- We confuse strict identity with similarity in at least four ways
  1. Masses of matter which change a very small proportion of their parts
  2. Gradual change of all parts of a thing
  3. Linguistic confusion between numeric and qualitative identity
  4. Attribute strict identities to constantly changing entities 

    
*** The importance of memory 
- Memory is not only the means by which we "discover" identity but also
  partly a metaphysical condition of such identities
- Causation is then used to explain connections between ideas in cases
  where we have no memory (p. 261-2)

*** Hume's Skepticism
 - Two problematic principles
        - (1) all our distinct perceptions are distinct existences
        - (2) the mind never perceives any real connection among distinct existences
    - Hume's problem of individuation
        - What distinguishes a mind as one mind?
            - causal connections (memory depends on causal connections too)
            - but causal association is defined in terms of causal connection in
              one mind
            - so no non-circular means of picking out one 'mind'
