<h3 id="the-real-distinction-argument">The real distinction argument</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>Three claims</p>
<dl>
<dt>Complete Being<sub>T</sub></dt>
<dd>a thinking thing can exist as a substance whose sole essence is thought.
</dd>
<dt>Complete Being<sub>B</sub></dt>
<dd>body can exist as a substance whose sole essence is extension.
</dd>
<dt>Mutual Exclusion</dt>
<dd>mental substance has no bodily modes, and bodily substance has no mental modes.
</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li><p>God's power</p>
<p>Part [A] says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[A] I know that everything which I clearly and distinctly understand is capable of being created by God so as to correspond exactly with my understanding of it. Hence the fact that I can clearly and distinctly understand one thing apart from another is enough to make me certain that the two things are distinct, since they are capable of being separated, at least by God. The question of what kind of power is required to bring about such a separation does not affect the judgement that the two things are distinct.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is what part A <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-modal/#ReaDis">seems to be arguing</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>I clearly and distinctly understand mind apart from body and body apart from mind.</li>
<li>God can bring about whatever I clearly and distinctly perceive.</li>
<li>God can bring about that mind is apart from body and body is apart from mind.</li>
<li>If God can bring about that mind is apart from body and body is apart from mind, then mind and body can exist apart.</li>
<li><p>∴ Mind and body can exist apart.</p></li>
<li><p>We want to know whether mind and body naturally exist apart, not whether God can miraculously separate them…</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Knowing one's essence</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[B] Thus, simply by knowing that I exist and seeing at the same time that absolutely nothing else belongs to my nature or essence except that I am a thinking thing, I can infer correctly that my essence consists solely in the fact that I am a thinking thing.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>One's self exists</li>
<li>Nothing belongs to one’s essence or nature other than thinking</li>
<li>∴ All properties of oneself have to be conceived via this essence – thought</li>
</ol>
<p>Is this argument enough to yield the Real Distinction? Presumably not – it just tells us that our essence is that of a thinking being, it doesn’t tell us that all thinking beings are independent of any body. It doesn’t give us Mutual Exclusion. But it does give us Complete Being-T.</p></li>
<li><p>Real distinctness</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[C] It is true that I may have (or, to anticipate, that I certainly have) a body that is very closely joined to me. But nevertheless, on the one hand I have a clear and distinct idea of myself, in so far as I am simply a thinking, non-extended thing; and on the other hand I have a distinct idea of body, in so far as this is simply an extended, non-thinking thing. And accordingly, it is certain that I am really distinct from my body, and can exist without it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to the Meditator's distinct and clear ideas:</p>
<ol>
<li>The self is a thinking and non-extended thing</li>
<li>Corporeal substance is extended and non-thinking</li>
</ol>
<p>This gives us <em>Mutual Exclusion</em>. If we assume Complete Being<sub>B</sub> then it seems D gives us what we need to conclude that mind and body are Really Distinct</p>
<ul>
<li>Is it clear that if a thing can exist that has no bodily properties then that thing can exist apart from bodies?
<ul>
<li>could there be some other kind of dependence relation between minds and bodies apart from modal/property dependence?
<ul>
<li>not, presumably, if we are talking about substances, since substances are independent beings</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Objections</p>
<ul>
<li>How do we know that the apparent distinctness of mind and body is not due to our ignorance of their real identity?</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Suppose someone knows for certain that the angle in a semi-circle is a right angle, and hence that the triangle formed by this angle and the diameter of the circle is right-angled. In spite of this, he may doubt, or not yet have grasped for certain, that the square on the hypotenuse is equal to the squares on the other two sides; indeed he may even deny this if he is misled by some fallacy. But now, if he uses the same argument as that proposed by our illustrious author, he may appear to have confirmation of his false belief, as follows: 'I clearly and distinctly perceive', he may say, 'that the triangle is right-angled; but I doubt that the square on the hypotenuse is equal to the squares on the other two sides; therefore it does not belong to the essence of the triangle that the square on its hypotenuse is equal to the squares on the other sides.' (7:201-2)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Descartes’s answer, perhaps unsurprisingly, refers to what the Meditator has learned so far</p>
<ul>
<li>(i) the fact that the Meditator has clear and distinct ideas of mind and body, where each excludes the features of other</li>
<li>(ii) the nature of clear and distinct ideas is such that they adequately represent how reality is (or what is really possible).</li>
</ul>
<p>So Descartes simply denies Arnauld’s premise, that the subject has a clear and distinct idea of a right triangle. If they really did have such an idea, Descartes argues, they would know that the Pythagorean theorem is true of such triangles.</p>
<p>To reject Descartes’s argument we must reject either</p>
<ul>
<li>(i) the claim that we (or the Meditator) have clear and distinct ideas of the mind as distinct from the body, or</li>
<li>(ii) that clear and distinct perception is a reliable guide to real possibility/actuality.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Causation:</p>
<p>The dualist position articulated here raises problems for D - how do minds and bodies interact, if at all?</p>
<ul>
<li>Interactionism</li>
<li>Occasionalism</li>
<li>Parallelism</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>

<ol>
<li><p>Elisabeth</p>
<ul>
<li>How could the mind move the body and vice versa?</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>it seems that all determination of movement happens through the impulsion of the thing moved, by the manner in which it is pushed by that which moves it, or else by the particular qualities and shape of the surface of the latter. Physical contact is required for the first two conditions, extension for the third. (3:661)</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Descartes</p>
<ul>
<li>There are 'primitive notions' (i.e. mind, body, and mind-body unity) and we cannot expect them to be explicable in any other way than through themselves</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Although the use of the senses has given us notions of extension, of shapes, and of movements that are much more familiar than the others, the principal cause of our errors lies in our ordinarily wanting to use these notions to explain those things to which they do not pertain. (3:666)</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>We confuse one kind of causation with another</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I believe that we have heretofore confused the notion of the power with which the soul acts on the body with the power with which one body acts on another; and that we have attributed the one and the other not to the soul, for we did not yet know it, but to diverse qualities of bodies, such as heaviness, heat, and others, which we have imagined to be real, that is to say, to have an existence distinct from that of body, and by consequence, to be substances, even though we have named them qualities. (3:667)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Garber summarizes this position by saying that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>General notions aside, we have within us three basic ideas, that of mind, that of body, and that of their union. Each is separate, each is distinct, and each has its own domain of application; each is per se intelligible, and cannot be explained in terms of other primitive notions.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Elisabeth</p>
<ul>
<li>immateriality is conceivable only as the &quot;negation of matter&quot; (3:684-5)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Descartes</p>
<ul>
<li>we cannot conceive clearly the mind-body union (3:691-2)</li>
<li>To think of thought as extended is just to think of the mind-body union (3:694)</li>
<li>Don't do too much abstract thinking (3:692-3), especially metaphysics (3:695)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Three positions on the mind-body relation</p>
