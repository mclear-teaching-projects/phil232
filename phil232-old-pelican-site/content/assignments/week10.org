This week we wrap up discussion of innate ideas and move on to look at Locke
and other's conception of the physical world (or material nature) as
/mechanistic/. We'll also look at Locke's arguments concerning our ability to
know essences.

** Reading Questions
- Do Galileo, Descartes, Boyle, and Locke all share the same
  conception of the material world (i.e. matter or corporeal nature)?
- What are "primary" and "secondary" qualities?
- Are there differences in the ways in which different figures argue
  for the primary/secondary distinction?
- To what extent does Locke think that we can achieve a scientific
  understanding of corporeal nature? Does his view differ from that of Descartes?
- What is the distinction between nominal and real essence?
- Does Locke think that there are mind-independent essences?
- What is the relation, for Locke, between corpuscularianism and his
  conception of (real) essence?
