* Locke's Project
- Working as an "underlaborer" for science
- Advance scientific understanding by removing itellectual obstacles
- Examination of our cognitive powers
  
* Locke on Innate Ideas
** Two versions of nativist thesis
*** Strong Nativism (I.ii.2-5)
Human beings are born with a "stock" of innate ideas and principles of which
they are aware 

1. There are some basic truths & principles to which all human beings consent
2. There would be no universal consent unless these truths & principles were
   innate
3. \therefore At least some basic truths & principles are innately known


- Locke: there are empirical counterexamples to universal consent (e.g.
  children, mentally disabled, etc.)
    - All ideas are conscious (consciously perceived -- see I.ii.5)
      
*** Weak Nativism (I.ii.6-14)
Once a human being reaches intellectual maturity (becomes a rational being),
that person will assent to the relevant truths or principles

**** Two versions of weak nativism (I.ii.7)
***** Innate ideas are those we assent to 'on first hearing' (I.ii.18)
****** False
Confuses self-evidence with innateness
***** Innate ideas are those we are disposed to know
****** False b/c absurd
Anything we might be able to know would be innate on this view, and all ideas cannot be innate

* Locke's Empiricism
- All ideas originate in experience (II.i.2)
  - External sense (sensation)
  - Internal sense (reflection)
    


- Content empiricism :: all the content of what we can think must be derived
     from experience 
     
- Justificatory empiricism :: everything that we can justify to be the case
     (and so know) must be derivable from experience
