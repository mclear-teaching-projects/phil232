* Quiz                                                             :noexport:
1. Hume distinguishes between two kinds basic element of them mind (two kinds of
   perception) -- what are they?
2. Name one law of association
3. What is the copy principle?
4. "Hume's Fork" distinguishes between two different kinds of knowledge. Name one
   - relations of ideas/matters of fact
5. T/F Knowledge of matters of fact can be had just by analyzing our ideas and
   their relations

* Positive conception of causation
** Redefinition of 'cause-effect'
1. Causation as constant conjunction (events of type A are followed by
   events of type B)
2. Causation as counterfactual dependence (if A had not occurred then B
   would not have occurred)
3. Causation as psychological responsiveness (the having of thoughts of
   type A 'always conveys' one to thoughts of type B)

   All causal inference is due to "custom" or habit.

* Personal Identity
** Genealogical argument 
- Where does the idea of a persisting self come from?
  - Not from experience (no impression of a persisting self, or self at
    all)
- Hume thus denies
  1. that the existence of an impression requires the existence of a
     subject of that impression (i.e. a "self")
  2. that we are aware of a subject of impressions or ideas in
     introspection
- So no impression of self -> idea of self is a fiction 
** The Bundle theory
- The 'self' is really just a constant flux of perceptions (of impressions and ideas) that are connected via associative forces, such that they constitute a 'bundle'
- There are no persisting bundles
** The origin of the idea of a (fictitious) self 
- Distinguish between 
  - Strict identity :: persistence without alteration
  - Similarity :: resemblance, in some respect, between distinct existences
