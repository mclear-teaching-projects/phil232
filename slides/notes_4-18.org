* Hume on the mind
- Two kinds of mental states
  1. impressions
  2. ideas
     
- Copy Principle :: all ideas are copies of impressions
                    
- All ideas are less phenomenologically "vivid" and "forceful/lively" than
  their corresponding impressions
  
- Three principles of association
  1. resemblance
  2. contiguity in time and space
  3. cause & effect

- Missing shade of blue
  - Not a counterexample (?) 
    
* Hume's Fork 
- Relations of ideas
  - certain
  - known just by thinking
  - independent of what actually exists
  - concern necessary truths
  - examples include mathematics, linguistic definition/stipulation
  - Negation is or entails a contradiction 
- Matters of fact
  - contingent
  - Negation is not (or does not entail) a contradiction
  - not knowable just by thinking
  - depends on what is/was actual 
    
- Analytic truths vs. synthetic truths
  - a priori :: knowable/justifiable just by thinking

  - a posteriori :: not knowable/justifiable just by thinking -- appeal to some
                    experience of the actual world

                    
- Is Hume's fork fully exhaustive & exclusive? 
  - could there be synthetic a priori truths/knowledge?

* Hume on Causation
- What is it to have causal knowledge of things?
- What give us certainty (knowledge) of matters of fact beyond that which
  we currently experience?

** Negative Argument 
*** Causal knowledge is not attained via relations of ideas
- The relation of an effect to its cause (and vice versa) can never be
  attained merely by analysis of the relevant ideas and their relations
  - No contradiction is implied by denying that some effect follows from
    (some conception of) a putative cause
  - Cause & effect are entirely distinct
  - No necessary connections between entirely distinct existences
*** Causal knowledge is not attained via a rational process of induction from matters of fact 
- Hume denies that causal reasoning from matters of fact is rational 
  1. In the past, when I have let go of solid objects suspended in the
     air, they have fallen.
  2. Therefore, When I let go of this object, it will fall 
     
- We have no rational justification for holding (2) on the basis of (1)
  - truth is not self-evident
  - no contradiction is implied by denial of (2) (i.e. negation of (2)
    is "conceivable")
  - no demonstrative (logical) relation between (1) and (2) 
    
- We have no rational basis for believing (2) on the basis of (1)
  - Any rational basis for induction over instances (enumerative
    induction) requires that we know that the future will be like the
    past (FLP)
    - We have no reason to believe FLP
      - No logical demonstration of the truth of FLP
      - Cannot accept FLP based on appeals top probability (i.e. on the
        FLP having been true previous) -- the claim that FLP is true
        based on past observation of FLP's truth is circular, it simply
        assumes that FLP is true
