<ol>
<li>I know with certainty that I am a thinking thing.</li>
<li>This knowledge is based solely on a clear and distinct perception of its truth.</li>
<li>Clear and distinct perception would not be sufficient to yield such knowledge if it were in any way fallible.</li>
<li><p>∴ Clear and distinct perception provides a sufficient ground for knowledge; whatever I so perceive is true.</p></li>
<li>Truth Rule :: whatever I perceive very clearly and distinctly is true</li>
<li><strong>Problem</strong>: could a deceitful god make me go astray even when I have C&amp;D ideas?
<ul>
<li>Reply: We have to (1) examine what ideas are and (2) prove that God exists and is no deceiver</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="ideas">Ideas</h2>
<ul>
<li>What are ideas?
<dl>
<dt>Mental &quot;representations&quot;</dt>
<dd>entities by means of which one is aware of things outside or independent of one's mind
</dd>
</dl></li>
<li>Two senses of &quot;reality&quot; of idea
<dl>
<dt>objective reality</dt>
<dd>what the idea is an idea <em>of</em> – the &quot;content&quot; of the idea
</dd>
<dt>formal reality</dt>
<dd>feature or &quot;mode&quot; of the mind
</dd>
</dl></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sources-of-ideas">Sources of Ideas</h2>
<ul>
<li>Where do our ideas (i.e. their content or objective reality) come from?</li>
<li>Three sources
<ol>
<li>Adventitious</li>
<li>Invented/imagined</li>
<li>Innate</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="innate-ideas">Innate ideas</h3>
<ul>
<li>What are innate ideas?
<ol>
<li>An idea one has simply in virtue of having a mind</li>
<li>An idea gained via reflection on or consciousness of one's nature</li>
</ol></li>
<li>What, if any, kinds of dependence relations exist between the various classes of ideas?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="modes-of-reality">Modes of reality</h2>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Existence&quot; is not &quot;reality&quot;
<ul>
<li>existence appeals to causality/causal effect</li>
<li>reality appeals to power of cause</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Reality as &quot;graded&quot;
<ol>
<li>Infinite substance</li>
<li>Finite substance</li>
<li>Modes (of substance) – i.e. properties</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-causal-principle">The Causal Principle</h2>
<dl>
<dt>The causal principle</dt>
<dd>there must be at least as much reality in the efficient and total cause as in the effect of that cause
</dd>
