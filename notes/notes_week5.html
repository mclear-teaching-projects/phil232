<ol>
<li>Name one source of our ideas that Descartes discusses
<ul>
<li>senses, observation, experience, &quot;adventitious&quot;</li>
<li>invented or imagined ideas</li>
<li>innate</li>
</ul></li>
<li>T/F: Descartes needs to prove that God exists to be certain that the &quot;cogito&quot; argument is true
<ul>
<li>F</li>
</ul></li>
<li>T/F: The truth rule states that whenever one thinks, what one thinks is true
<ul>
<li>F</li>
</ul></li>
<li>T/F: The Med 2 wax argument presupposes that bodies exist
<ul>
<li>F</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What is the formal reality of an idea?
<dl>
<dt>formal reality</dt>
<dd>the way an idea exists – as a mode or property of the mind
</dd>
<dt>objective reality</dt>
<dd>what the idea is about or represents – its &quot;content&quot;
</dd>
</dl></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="med-4---the-theory-of-error">Med 4 - The theory of error</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>I perceive that the power of willing which I received from God is not, when considered in itself, the cause of my mistakes for it is both extremely ample and also perfect of its kind. Nor is my power of understanding to blame for since my understanding comes from God, everything that I understand I undoubtedly understand correctly, and any error here is impossible. So what then is the source of my mistakes? It must be simply this: the scope of the will is wider than that of the intellect; but instead of restricting it within the same limits, I extend its use to matters which I do not understand. Since the will is indifferent in such cases, it easily turns aside from what is true and good, and this is the source of my error and sin. (7:58)</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The source of error is willing to believe something that is false, or for which one lacks sufficient evidence</li>
<li>We choose or &quot;will&quot; to believe or deny the judgments or ideas presented by the understanding</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="error-as-evil-three-responses">Error as evil – three responses</h3>
<ol>
<li>Maybe we can't always understand God's actions (7:55)</li>
<li>Imperfections/evils should be understood at the level of all of creation, not locally</li>
<li>In our case, error is the function of a relationship between our faculties</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="three-kinds-of-causal-influence">Three kinds of causal influence</h3>
<ol>
<li>Interactionism</li>
<li>Occasionalism
<ul>
<li>direct causal intervention</li>
<li>indirect causal intervention via laws of nature</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Parallelism (divine harmony)</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="med-5---essence-ontological-argument">Med 5 - Essence &amp; Ontological Argument</h2>
<ol>
<li>Essence of matter is extension (7:63, 71)</li>
<li>Innate ideas of essences (7:63–5)</li>
<li>Ontological argument (7:65–8)</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="essence-of-matter">Essence of matter</h3>
<p>The essence of matter is &quot;continuous quantity&quot; or extension</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quantity, for example, or 'continuous' quantity as the philosophers commonly call it, is something I distinctly imagine. That is, I distinctly imagine the extension of the quantity (or rather of the thing which is quantified) in length, breadth and depth. I also enumerate various parts of the thing, and to these parts I assign various sizes, shapes, positions and local motions; and to the motions I assign various durations. (7:63)</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="extension-as-primary-attribute">Extension as &quot;Primary Attribute&quot;</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Primary attribute as essential property of a substance</p></li>
<li><p>essential property :: (i) necessary property of a thing that (ii) makes it the kind of thing that it is and (iii) explains other properties that a thing may have</p></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Intellectual/intelligible claim :: idea of quantity entails other ideas (extension entails &amp; is entailed by shape, size, etc)</li>
<li>Metaphysical claim : reality is such that if there is extension then there is a metaphysical dependence of size, shape, etc., on it</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="the-ontological-argument">The ontological argument</h3>
<ol>
<li>Whatever I C+D perceive to belong to the essence of a thing does</li>
<li>I C+D perceive that the essence of God includes every perfection</li>
<li>It is more perfect to exist than not to existence (existence is a perfection)</li>
<li>∴ Existence is necessarily part of God's essence</li>
<li>∴ God necessarily exists</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="objections">Objections</h3>
<ol>
<li>We don't have a C+D perception of God's essence, which means we don't have a C+D perception of whether that essence includes existence</li>
<li>Why think that existence is a perfection?
<ul>
<li>maybe &quot;exist&quot; doesn't pick out a property in anything like the way &quot;hot&quot; or &quot;good&quot; does – &quot;existence&quot; isn't a &quot;real predicate&quot;</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
