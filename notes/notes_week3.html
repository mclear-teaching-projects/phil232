<ul>
<li>There is no seems/is distinction with respect to certain classes of thought</li>
<li>How can we be certain that we have the nature that the Meditator claims that we have (as thinking substance)? – Maybe we are just thoughts of the &quot;world soul&quot;?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="objections-review">Objections (review)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Begging the question
<ul>
<li>Remove problem by introducing premises?
<ol>
<li>There is thinking</li>
<li>For any instantiated property there is a thing—a &quot;substance&quot;—that has that property</li>
<li>So there is a thinking thing (1,2)</li>
<li>So I am thinking</li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Invalid argument
<ul>
<li>Can't move from impersonal premises to 1st person conclusion</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a-defense">A defense</h2>
<p>Lichtenberg's objection: &quot;there is no subject of thought – D's starting point should be: 'there is thought&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>(T1) It is thought: P</li>
<li>(T2) It is thought: Q</li>
</ul>
<p>But then we can't infer from T1 &amp; T2 that</p>
<ul>
<li>(T3) It is thought: P &amp; Q</li>
</ul>
<p>From Lichtenberg's starting point we can't explain the &quot;unity&quot; of thought – perhaps this justifies the starting point of Descartes's <em>Cogito</em> argument?</p>
<h2 id="the-wax-argument">The Wax Argument</h2>
<p>Aims to show two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>the nature of body is known via intellect not senses (7:30-1)</li>
<li>the nature of mind is better known than body (7:33)</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="the-argument">The Argument</h3>
<ol>
<li>I can grasp that this melted wax is flexible and changeable so as to be capable of innumerable changes of shape.</li>
<li>Imagination could allow me to grasp this fact only by representing these changes by an image of each possible shape.</li>
<li>My imagination cannot represent the innumerable shapes required.</li>
<li>So it is not the imagination that allows me to grasp this capability of the wax.</li>
<li>But I do grasp this capability, so it must be by a faculty other than (sense or) imagination: call it the &quot;intellect&quot;.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="quiz">Quiz</h2>
<ol>
<li>What is the &quot;cogito&quot; argument?
<ul>
<li>&quot;I think, I exist&quot; is true whenever I think it</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Name one way in which the argument is problematic
<ul>
<li>begs the question</li>
<li>invalid</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What does Descartes assume is entailed by the existence of a thought?
<ul>
<li>a thinker (i.e. a substance that has the property of thinking)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>T/F: The Meditator claims that it can be certain that it is a &quot;thinking thing&quot;?
<ul>
<li>T</li>
</ul></li>
<li>T/F: The wax argument shows that body is known via the senses only
<ul>
<li>F</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-nature-of-the-subject-as-a-thinking-thing">The nature of the subject as a thinking thing</h2>
<p>Descartes further understands the 'I' in terms of the kinds of activity it can undertake. A thinking thing is &quot;a thing that doubts, understands, affirms, denies, is willing, is unwilling, and also imagines and has sensory perceptions” (7:28).</p>
<p>What makes all these characteristic activities go together?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>one and same being is <strong>conscious</strong> of engaging in all these kinds of activity</p>
<ol>
<li>What makes a &quot;mind&quot; a mind?</li>
<li>What are the identity conditions under which a particular mind persists?</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="results-of-the-cogito">Results of the Cogito</h2>
<ul>
<li>The results of the Cogito inquiry
<ul>
<li>I am certain that:
<ul>
<li>I exist</li>
<li>I exist as a thinking thing</li>
<li>A thinking thing is a thing that doubts, understands, affirms, denies, is willing or unwilling, imagines, and has sensory perceptions</li>
<li>The intellect is an essential feature of a mind, and of all mental activities</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="three-possible-uses-of-the-cogito">Three possible uses of the cogito</h2>
<ol>
<li>the 'foundationalist' answer: what is certain is a 'first principle' from which we derive other knowledge;</li>
<li>the 'systematicity' answer: what is certain is systematically connected with other knowledge (e.g. knowledge that 2 + 2 = 4 might be systematically related to knowledge that 1 + 1 + 2 = 4, etc.);</li>
<li>the 'methodological' answer: what is certain reveal a method for deriving other certainties.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="meditation-3">Meditation 3</h2>
<ol>
<li>I know with certainty that I am a thinking thing.</li>
<li>This knowledge is based solely on a clear and distinct perception of its truth.</li>
<li>Clear and distinct perception would not be sufficient to yield such knowledge if it were in any way fallible.</li>
<li>∴ Clear and distinct perception provides a sufficient ground for knowledge; whatever I so perceive is true.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dt>Truth Rule</dt>
<dd>Whenever I C&amp;D perceive then what I perceive is true &amp; I can be certain of it <em>as such</em>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><strong>Problem</strong>: could a deceitful god make me go astray even when I have C&amp;D ideas?</li>
</ul>
