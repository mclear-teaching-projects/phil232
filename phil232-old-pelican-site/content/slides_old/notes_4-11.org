* Hume's /Enquiry/
- Wants us to burn books, specifically scholastic metaphysics 
** Aims of the Enquiry
- Articulate the nature of human understanding---i.e. the nature and
  character of human cognitive powers
- Pessimistic skepticism concerning the nature and reach of human
  cognitive powers, especially the intellect (understanding and reason)

* Hume's Mind
- Wants to be the "Newton of the mind"
  
** Hume's empiricism 
*** Two Kinds of Perception 
1. Impressions - more vivid and forceful
2. Ideas - less vivid and forceful

- Where "force and vivacity" are understood in broadly
  phenomenological/phenomenal terms 
  
- Ideas seem also to be distinguished from impressions by virtue of
  their origin/etiology: they are brought about via some sort of
  reflection or awareness of impressions

*** The Copy Principle
- All our ideas are copies of impressions
  
- Condition on meaning -- we can only think about what we have had an
  impression of, or what can be derived from what we have had an
  impression of
  
- Hume will ultimately criticize metaphysics based on its failure to
  satisfy the copy principle 
  
*** The Missing Shade of Blue
- Possible counterexample to the copy principle?
- Denies that it is a genuine problem for the principle
