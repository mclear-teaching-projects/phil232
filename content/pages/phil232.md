# Course Description #

This course offers an introductory survey of the views of some key
figures in early modern (17th—18th century) European philosophy. These
include at least the following: Descartes, Locke, Leibniz, Newton, Hume,
and Kant. Our main focus will be on the enormously influential theories
of René Descartes, specifically his theories of mind and nature, as well
as subsequent reactions, criticisms, and (partial) defenses of his views
in the writings of other prominent philosophers. Major themes include
the nature of mind and matter, the structure of scientific explanation,
causation and necessity, free will, and the existence of God.
