<ul>
<li>There is no seems/is distinction with respect to certain classes of thought</li>
<li>How can we be certain that we have the nature that the Meditator claims that we have (as thinking substance)? – Maybe we are just thoughts of the &quot;world soul&quot;?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="objections-review">Objections (review)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Begging the question
<ul>
<li>Remove problem by introducing premises?
<ol>
<li>There is thinking</li>
<li>For any instantiated property there is a thing—a &quot;substance&quot;—that has that property</li>
<li>So there is a thinking thing (1,2)</li>
<li>So I am thinking</li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Invalid argument
<ul>
<li>Can't move from impersonal premises to 1st person conclusion</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a-defense">A defense</h2>
<p>Lichtenberg's objection: &quot;there is no subject of thought – D's starting point should be: 'there is thought&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>(T1) It is thought: P</li>
<li>(T2) It is thought: Q</li>
</ul>
<p>But then we can't infer from T1 &amp; T2 that</p>
<ul>
<li>(T3) It is thought: P &amp; Q</li>
</ul>
<p>From Lichtenberg's starting point we can't explain the &quot;unity&quot; of thought – perhaps this justifies the starting point of Descartes's <em>Cogito</em> argument?</p>
<h2 id="the-wax-argument">The Wax Argument</h2>
<p>Aims to show two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>the nature of body is known via intellect not senses (7:30-1)</li>
<li>the nature of mind is better known than body (7:33)</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="the-argument">The Argument</h3>
<ol>
<li>I can grasp that this melted wax is flexible and changeable so as to be capable of innumerable changes of shape.</li>
<li>Imagination could allow me to grasp this fact only by representing these changes by an image of each possible shape.</li>
<li>My imagination cannot represent the innumerable shapes required.</li>
<li>So it is not the imagination that allows me to grasp this capability of the wax.</li>
<li>But I do grasp this capability, so it must be by a faculty other than (sense or) imagination: call it the &quot;intellect&quot;.</li>
</ol>
