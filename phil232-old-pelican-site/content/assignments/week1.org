particular on his conception of philosophical method.

** Reading Questions
While you read, think about how you might answer the following
questions. We'll discuss these further in class. 

1. How, if at all, do the explanatory ambitions of scholastic science differ from
   those of contemporary science?
2. What is Descartes's proposed method for acquiring knowledge?
3. What area of inquiry does Descartes's method seem most useful for? Could it
   be used in all areas equally well?
