<li>What is epistemic foundationalism?</li>
<li>(T/F) Descartes's method of doubt requires that we believe all of our beliefs are false</li>
<li>Why does Descartes employ his method of doubt?</li>
<li>Name one of the stages of doubt</li>
</ol>

<li>Cosmology</li>
<li>Causal structure of nature (4 causes)</li>
<li>Hylomorphism</li>
<li>Aristotelian empiricism</li>
<li>Demonstrative science (is it possible?)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="descartes">Descartes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Rene Descartes (1596-1650); <em>Discourse on the Method</em> (1637) &amp; The <em>Meditations</em> (1641)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-method">The Method</h3>
<p>Descartes puts his method this way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first was never to accept anything as true if I did not have evident knowledge of its truth: that is, carefully to avoid precipitate conclusions and preconceptions, and to include nothing more in my judgements than what presented itself to my mind so clearly and so distinctly that I had no occasion to doubt it.</p>
<p>The second, to divide each of the difficulties I examined into as many parts as possible and as may be required in order to resolve them better.</p>
<p>The third, to direct my thoughts in an orderly manner, by beginning with the simplest and most easily known objects in order to ascend little by little, step by step, to knowledge of the most complex, and by supposing some order even among objects that have no natural order of precedence.</p>
<p>And the last, throughout to make enumerations so complete, and reviews so comprehensive, that I could be sure of leaving nothing out. (AT VI:18-19)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can put the method more concisely as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Accept as true only that for which one has proper evidence—viz., clear and distinct ideas;</li>
<li>Resolve problems into their simplest parts</li>
<li>Move from the simple and known to the complex</li>
<li>Thoroughly review and check one’s work to be sure it is comprehensive and complete</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="the-meditations">The Meditations</h3>
<ul>
<li>Meditation as literary form</li>
<li>Tree metaphor for all human knowledge: &quot;The roots are metaphysics, the trunk is physics, and the branches emerging from the trunk are all the other sciences, which may be reduced to three principal ones, namely medicine, mechanics and morals” (AT IXB 14: CSM I 186)</li>

<h3 id="the-cogito-argument">The Cogito Argument</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>I have convinced myself that there is absolutely nothing in the world, no sky, no earth, no minds, no bodies. Does it now follow that I too do not exist? No: if I convinced myself of something then I certainly existed. But there is a deceiver of supreme power and cunning who is deliberately and constantly deceiving me. In that case I too undoubtedly exist, if he is deceiving me; and let him deceive me as much as he can, he will never bring it about that I am nothing so long as I think that I am something. So after considering everything very thoroughly, I must finally conclude that this proposition, <em>I am, I exist</em>, is necessarily true whenever it is put forward by me or conceived in my mind. (7:25)</p>
