<h2 id="meditation-3">Meditation 3</h2>
<ol>
<li>I know with certainty that I am a thinking thing.</li>
<li>This knowledge is based solely on a clear and distinct perception of its truth.</li>
<li>Clear and distinct perception would not be sufficient to yield such knowledge if it were in any way fallible.</li>
<li>∴ Clear and distinct perception provides a sufficient ground for knowledge; whatever I so perceive is true.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dt>Truth Rule</dt>
<dd>whatever I perceive very clearly and distinctly is true
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><strong>Problem</strong>: could a deceitful god make me go astray even when I have C&amp;D ideas?
<ul>
<li>Reply: We have to (1) examine what ideas are and (2) prove that God exists and is no deceiver</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ideas">Ideas</h3>
<ul>
<li>What are ideas?
<dl>
<dt>Mental &quot;representations&quot;</dt>
<dd>entities by means of which one is aware of things outside or independent of one's mind
</dd>
</dl></li>
<li>Two senses of &quot;reality&quot; of idea
<dl>
<dt>objective reality</dt>
<dd>what the idea is an idea <em>of</em> – the &quot;content&quot; of the idea
</dd>
<dt>formal reality</dt>
<dd>feature or &quot;mode&quot; of the mind
</dd>
</dl></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sources-of-ideas">Sources of Ideas</h3>
<ul>
<li>Where do our ideas (i.e. their content or objective reality) come from?</li>
<li>Three sources
<ol>
<li>Adventitious</li>
<li>Invented/imagined</li>
<li>Innate</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><p>Innate ideas</p>
<ul>
<li>What are innate ideas?
<ol>
<li>An idea one has simply in virtue of having a mind</li>
<li>An idea gained via reflection on or consciousness of one's nature</li>
</ol></li>
<li>What, if any, kinds of dependence relations exist between the various classes of ideas?</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="modes-of-reality">Modes of reality</h3>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Existence&quot; is not &quot;reality&quot;
<ul>
<li>existence appeals to causality/causal effect</li>
<li>reality appeals to power of cause</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Reality as &quot;graded&quot;
<ol>
<li>Infinite substance</li>
<li>Finite substance</li>
<li>Modes (of substance) – i.e. properties</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-causal-principle">The Causal Principle</h3>
<dl>
<dt>The causal principle</dt>
<dd>there must be at least as much reality in the efficient and total cause as in the effect of that cause
</dd>
</dl>
<h3 id="rationalism-the-psr">Rationalism &amp; the PSR</h3>
<ul>
<li>Question : why can't something come from nothing?</li>
<li>Rationalist assumption :: the principles governing the structure of nature mirror or are identical with the principles governing the structure of our ideas</li>
<li>The Principle of Sufficient Reason :: For every truth or fact there is a sufficient reason</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-causal-argument">The Causal argument</h3>
<ol>
<li>The objective reality of an idea must have a cause equal to it or greater</li>
<li>The objective reality of my idea of God is that of an omni-omni-omni substance</li>
<li>No finite being has sufficient reality to cause the content of my idea of God</li>
<li>∴ The cause of the objective reality of the idea must be God</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="objections">Objections</h3>
<ol>
<li>Do we really have such an idea of God?
<ul>
<li>We must because of the &quot;priority of the infinite&quot;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Does the idea of God really require an <strong>infinite</strong> cause?
<ul>
<li>No concept of an infinite being could be constructed from finite (e.g. sensory) materials</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="argument-for-gods-existence-based-on-the-preservation-of-finite-substance">Argument for God's existence based on the preservation of finite substance</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Question</em>: could I (the meditator) have existed if no &quot;more perfect&quot; being existed (7:48) ?</li>
<li>Four possible sources of my existence:
<ol>
<li>self-causation</li>
<li>parents</li>
<li>some other finite being</li>
<li>God</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Against (1): only an infinite power could create something from nothing</p></li>
<li><p>Preservation principle :: There is no distinction between preservation of existence and creation</p></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Any entity that exists exists at discrete moments that are independent of each other</li>
<li>The existence of a substance at one moment does not give it the power to exist at any other subsequent moment</li>
<li>Existence at a moment requires an act equivalent to creation (preservation = creation)</li>
<li>No finite entity can create itself</li>
<li>∴ no finite entity can preserve itself from one moment to the next</li>
<li>∴ there must be some entity capable of creation &amp; preservation</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="meditation-4">Meditation 4</h2>
<ul>
<li>God is no deceiver and all-powerful, so why is it that we are created with the capacity for error? How is this compatible with the existence of a God so conceived?</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>when I concentrate on the nature of God, it seems impossible that he should have placed in me a faculty which is not perfect of its kind, or which lacks some perfection which it ought to have…There is, moreover, no doubt that God could have given me a nature such that I was never mistaken; again, there is no doubt that he always wills what is best. Is it then better that I should make mistakes than that I should not do so? (7:55)</p>
