      - [ ] Substance objection (omitted premise) 
- [ ] Student questions for M2
   + [ ] Cyrus: Why can't we be deceived about our own existence?
      - "why would this demon not be able to provide someone with a false sense of existence?  Could Descartes, his thoughts, and entire sense of self not be a thought within the mind of the evil demon?"
   + [ ] Kendric: "The idea is: can this "self" or "I" that Descartes's lays out be divided? Could it be possible that there is a "thinking object" that is one's train of thought and an "observer" that just perceives the "thinking object", where the "observer" is the only part of the "self"? In this fashion, if "thinking object" is not part of the "self", then could it be controlled by the aforementioned evil demon in the first meditation, and result is a "self" that is a simple machine that only observes and does not do any thinking; only what seems like thinking?"
   + [ ] Tadhg (and Matthew): "I don't understand the argument that there can be a thought all by itself. I can see an argument being made that we aren't beings or that we don't have physical form but are simply thoughts, but to me, even if I am just formless thoughts, I still exist"
   + [ ] Riley, Muhammad, Alexander: What is going on with the wax argument? Why
     is it impossible to "understand" [sic] the various ways in which the wax
     can change (though see Kendric's answer)
   + [ ] Zachery: Is D claiming that the the ONLY certainty was that "I exist" or if it's just a certainty?

*** Question about Spinoza's Monism
- How is it that a single substance can have a plurality of attributes? Especially if
  these attributes are radically different from one another (e.g. as are /thought/ and /extension/)?
   + Another way to put this is how there can be a "true unity" that is or
     nevertheless possesses a plurality of essences/natures/attributes
     #+begin_quote
     E1P10S: although two attributes may be conceived to be really distinct (i.e.,
     one may be conceived without the aid of the other), we still cannot infer from
     that that they constitute two beings, or two different substances. For it is of
     the nature of a substance that each of its attributes is conceived through
     itself, since all the attributes it has have always been in it together, and one
     could not be produced by another, but each expresses the reality, or being of
     substance. (90)
     #+end_quote
      - It seems like S's answer here depends on his view that substance is
        absolutely infinite, that attributes cannot be shared, and that each attribute is conceived in and through itself
        #+begin_quote
        E1P10S: each being must be conceived under some attribute, and the more
        reality, or being it has, the more it has attributes which express necessity,
        or eternity, and infinity. And consequently there is also nothing clearer
        than that a being absolutely infinite must be defined (as we taught in D6) as
        a being that consists of infinite attributes, each of which expresses a
        certain eternal and infinite essence. (90)
        #+end_quote
      - A problem is that while it is true that each attribute exists necessarily and
        that none can exist without the others (because all are necessary), it is not
        true that an attribute exists in virtue of any other, so there is no
        connection between attributes that could unify them other than the fact that
        a substance cannot share attributes.
