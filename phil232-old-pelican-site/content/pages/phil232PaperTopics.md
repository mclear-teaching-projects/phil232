title: Phil 232 - Paper Topics
status: hidden

---

Papers should range between 3-6 double spaced pages (750-1500 words). Some
latitude is allowed here, but less than three pages is unlikely to be enough to
answer any of questions raised below. Similarly, you shouldn't need more than
six pages to answer the prompt satisfactorily. Please follow the formatting
directions specified on the syllabus.

I expect papers to be:

1. *Clear*: Write in short and complete sentences. Where possible, sacrifice elegance in favor of clarity. Signpost heavily. Avoid needless generality.
2. *Arguments*: Your paper should have a thesis for which it argues. Autobiographical reportage should be kept to a minimum. Present reasons for your position, and present counterarguments where relevant. 
3. *Appropriately Sourced*: To the extent that you consult secondary sources (you are free to do so but not required) you must document them in a bibliography. This means any sources you consulted, not just what you explicitly quote. I also expect you to make appropriate use of the primary sources relevant to your discussion (e.g. Descartes's *Meditations*, or Locke's *Essay*). When referring to a figure's ideas, cite the relevant area of the text in which this idea is expressed or referred to.

I would like to see a __paper proposal__, consisting of (i) a thesis statement;
(ii) a sketch of your argument, sent to me **by email** no later than __Friday,
March 17^th^__. Please put "phil 232 paper proposal" in the subject line.

## Paper topics

1. Descartes's '*cogito*' argument aims at demonstrating at least the following
   two claims: (i) that the Meditator exists; (ii) the nature of the Mediator
   is that of a thinking thing. Is Descartes successful here? Why/Why not? You
   might discuss at least the 'Lichtenburg' objection, and the 'Substance
   Theory' proposal as outlined in the class notes.
2. Descartes and Locke take opposing positions as to whether we can have
   scientific knowledge (demonstrative knowledge that is explanatory, systematic
   and secure) of the natural world. Explain their opposing positions. Are there
   reasons to favor one figure over the other?
3. Explain Locke's criticisms of innate ideas and discuss the various replies to
   these criticisms by Leibniz. Are Leibniz's replies convincing, and if so why?
4. Leibniz is highly critical of the prevailing theory of matter of his time.
   Explain his critical arguments. Are they convincing? If not then explain why.
   If they are, explain why, and discuss the structure of his idealist theory in
   the *Monadology*. Is his positive position convincing?
